= resetenv

This role permits to install/configure a basic development environment.

== Features
* Dynamically configures proxy settings (dnf, docker)
* Installs and configures :
** some basic packages
** some basic config files
** docker, docker-compose, docker-machine
** SublimeText3
** Atom
** ssh config files

== Prerequisites
* Fedora 22
* Ansible (currently tested on 1.9.2)

== Install & Configure it

Get the code source :
[source]
$ git clone <REPO_URL> /local/path

Sensitive data and variables are located in "vaulted" files inside the `vars` directory. 

If you want to reuse this role, you must create your vaulted files with your own data and "vault" them with your own password.


You have to create three vaulted files inside a `vars` directory (not "versioned" files) :

* `common-vars.yml.vault` : containing common variables
* `sshconfig.yml.vault` : containing SSH config variables 
* `work-vars.yml.vault` : containing work specific variables

=== Configure common variables
[source]
$ ansible-vault create vars/common-vars.yml.vault

Example of common-vars.yml.vault file content :
[source, yaml]
  ---
  user:
    name: mikl
    fullName: Michael Pailloncy
    email: mpapo.dev@gmail.com
    home: /home/mikl
  cachedir: /home/mikl/.ansible-cache
  tools:
    path: /home/mikl/tools
  proxy:
    host: my-work-proxy.hostname

WARNING: You need to replace all `$variables` by your specific values

By default, `resetenv` script will search a file named `.vault-password` containing your password and use it to "unvault" your data.
You need to create it inside resetenv directory :

[source]
$ echo "yourP@ssw0rd" > .vault-password

=== Configure SSH config variables
[source]
$ ansible-vault create vars/sshconfig.yml.vault

Example of sshconfig.yml.vault file content :
[source, yaml]
---
sshconfig:
   hosts:
     host1: >
          Host host1
            HostName hostname1
            User userhost1
     host2: >
          Host host2
            HostName hostname2
            User userhost2
     ...

=== Configure Work specific variables

[source]
$ ansible-vault create vars/work-vars.yml.vault

Example of work-vars.yml.vault file content :

[source, yaml]
---
user:
  name: mikl
  fullName: Michael Pailloncy
  email: work-email@company.fr
  home: /home/mikl
docker_internal_registry: "my-internal-docker-registry.hostname"
proxy:
  host: $workProxyHost
  port: $workProxyPort
  user: $workProxyUsername
  password: $workProxyPassword
proxy_env:
  http_proxy: 'http://{{ proxy.user }}:{{ proxy.password }}@{{ proxy.host }}:{{ proxy.port }}'
  https_proxy: 'http://{{ proxy.user }}:{{ proxy.password }}@{{ proxy.host }}:{{ proxy.port }}'
  no_proxy: '127.0.0.1,$internalDockerRegistryHostname'

WARNING: You need to replace all `$variables` by your specific values

=== Run it !

WARNING: Make sure that you have read all actions made by this playbook and saved all files susceptible to be erased (zshrc, ssh config files, docker config files, etc) before run it on a non "config-managed" environment.

[source]
$ ./resetenv

TIP: resetenv shell script is added in your PATH after provisioning (see zshrc template file). With a fresh new terminal, you can run it anywhere.

TIP: You can add any `ansible-playbook` options to resetenv shell script. Example: `resetenv -t fast` for a fast and basic reconfiguration (using `fast` tag).

== Everyday usage

After a first full provisioning has been done, the only way I'm using `resetenv` is to reset basic configuration files (docker, dnf, http_proxy settings) depending on my current location (work vs home).

Examples : 

[source]
$ r -t fast

or more often : 

[source]
$ twork

This command is an alias to do a `resetenv -t fast` and start tmunixator directly configured depending on my location (see `templates/zshrc` and `templates/tmuxinator/work.yml`).

== TODO
* manage SSH private/public key (vaulted)
* manage home/work Maven settings
* update atom/sublime-text plugins and configuration
